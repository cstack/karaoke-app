she's golden\nShe lives for me, says she lives for me\nOvation, her own motivation\nShe comes round and she goes down on me\nAnd I make her smile, like a drug for you\nDo ever what you wanna do, comin' over you\nKeep on smilin' what we go through\nOne stop to the rhythm, that divides you\nAnd I speak to you like the chorus to the verse\nChop another line like a coda with a curse\nCome on like a freak show takes the stage\nWe give them the games to play, she said\nI want somethin' else\nTo get me through this\nSemi-charmed kinda life\nBaby, baby\nI want somethin' else\nI'm not listenin' when you say\nGoodbye\n♪\nThe sky was gold, it was rose\nI was takin' sips of it through my nose\nAnd I wish I could get back there, someplace back there\nSmilin' in the pictures you would take\nDoin' crystal meth, will lift you up until you break\nIt won't stop, I won't come down\nI keep stock with the tick-tock rhythm\nI bump for the drop, and then I bumped up\nI took the hit that I was given, then I bumped again\nThen I bumped again, I said\nHow do I get back there\nTo the place where I fell asleep inside you?\nHow do I get myself back to the place where you said\nI want somethin' else\nTo get me through this\nSemi-charmed kinda life\nBaby, baby\nI want somethin' else\nI'm not listenin' when you say\nGoodbye\nI believe in the sand beneath my toes\nThe beach gives a feeling, an earthy feeling\nI believe in the faith that grows\nAnd the four right chords can make me cry\nWhen I'm with you I feel like I could die\nAnd that would be alright, alright\nAnd when the plane came in, she said she was crashin'\nThe velvet it rips in the city\nWe tripped on the urge to feel alive\nNow I'm struggling to survive\nThose days you were wearing that velvet dress\nYou're the priestess, I must confess\nThose little red panties they pass the test\nSlides up around the belly, face down on the mattress\nOne\nAnd you hold me, and we're broken\nStill it's all that I wanna do, just a little now\nFeel myself, heavy on the ground\nI'm scared, I'm not comin' down\nNo, no\nAnd I won't run for my life\nShe's got her jaws now locked down in a smile\nBut nothin' is alright, alright\nAnd I want somethin' else\nTo get me through this life\nBaby, I want somethin' else\nNot listenin' when you say\nGoodbye\nGoodbye\nGoodbye\nGoodbye\n♪\nThe sky was gold, it was rose\nI was takin' sips of it through my nose\nAnd I wish I could get back there, someplace back there\nIn the place we used to start\n♪\nI want somethin' else\n"},{"title":"Shake It Off","artist":"Taylor

gazing out of her window\nStaring at a son that she just can't touch\nIf at any time he's in a jam, she'll be by his side\nBut he doesn't realize he hurts her so much\nBut all the praying just ain't helping at all\n'Cause he can't seem to keep his self out of trouble\nSo, he goes out, and he makes his money the best way he know how\nAnother body laying cold in the gutter\nListen to me\nDon't go chasing waterfalls\nPlease stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to\nI know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all\nBut I think you're moving too fast\nLittle precious has a natural obsession\nFor temptation, but he just can't see\nShe give him loving that his body can't handle\nBut all he can say is, \"Baby, it's good to me\"\nOne day he goes and takes a glimpse in the mirror\nBut he doesn't recognize his own face\nHis health is fading and he doesn't know why\nThree letters took him to his final resting place\nY'all don't hear me\nDon't go chasing waterfalls\nPlease

rivers and the lakes that you're used to\nI know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all\nBut I think you're moving too fast (come on)\nI seen a rainbow yesterday\nBut too many storms have come and gone\nLeavin' a trace of not on God-given ray\nIs it because my life is ten shades of gray\nI pray all ten fade away\nSeldom praise Him for the sunny days\nAnd like his promise is true\nOnly my faith can undo\nThe many chances I blew\nWill it bring my life to anew\nClear blue and unconditional skies\nHave dried the tears from my eyes\nNo more lonely cries\nMy only bleedin' hope is for the folk who can't cope\nWit' such an endurin' pain\nThat it keeps 'em in the pourin' rain\nWho's to blame for tootin' cane in your own vein\nWhat a shame\nYou shoot and aim for someone else's brain\nYou claim the insane and name this day in time\nFor fallin' prey to crime\nI say the system got you victim to your own mind\nDreams are hopeless aspirations\nIn hopes of comin' true\nBelieve in yourself\nThe rest is up to me and you\nDon't go chasing waterfalls\nPlease stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to\nI know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all\nBut I think you're moving too fast (oh, you're moving)\nDon't go chasing waterfalls\nPlease stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to\nI know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at
