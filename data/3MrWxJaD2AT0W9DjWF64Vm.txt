Come on Eileen

Poor old Johnny Ray
Sounded sad upon the radio
Moved a million hearts in mono
Our mothers cried
Sang along, who'd blame them?
You're grown (you're grown up)
So grown (so grown up)
Now I must say more than ever
(Come on Eileen)
Toora loora toora loo rye ay
And we can sing just like our fathers
Come on Eileen, oh I swear what he means
At this moment, you mean everything
You in that dress, my thoughts I confess
Verge on dirty, ah, come on Eileen
♪
Come on Eileen

These people round here
Wear beatdown eyes sunk in smoke dried face
So resigned to what their fate is
But not us (no never)
No not us (no never)
We are far too young and clever
(Remember)
Toora loora, toora loo rye ay
Eileen, I'll hum this tune forever
Come on Eileen, oh I swear (what he means)
Ah come on let's, take off everything
Pretty red dress, Eileen, tell him yes
Ah come on let's, ah, come on Eileen
That pretty red dress, Eileen, tell him yes
Ah, come on let's, ah come on Eileen, please
Come on Eileen, too loo rye ay
Come on Eileen, too loo rye ay
Now you have grown, and now you have shown
Oh, Eileen
Said
Come on Eileen, too loo rye ay
Come on Eileen, too loo rye ay
Now I must say more than ever
Things round here change
I said, toora loora, toora loo rye ay
Come on Eileen, oh I swear what he means
At this moment, you mean everything
You in that dress, my thoughts I confess
Verge on dirty, ah come on Eileen
Come on Eileen, oh I swear what he means
At this moment, you mean everything
In that dress, oh my thoughts, I confess
Well, they're dirty, come on Eileen
Come on Eileen
