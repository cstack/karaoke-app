Behind my back
The bottle is ready to blow

I can't confront you
I never could do
That which might hurt you
To try and be cool
When I say
This way is a waterslide away from me
That takes her further every day
So be cool

Dear daddy, I write you
In spite of years of silence
You've cleaned up, found Jesus
Things are good, or so I hear
This bottle of Steven's awakens ancient feelings
Like father, stepfather
The son is drowning in the flood
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Say it ain't so
