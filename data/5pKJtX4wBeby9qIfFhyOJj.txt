Don't go breaking my heart
I couldn't if I tried
Honey, if I get restless
Baby, you're not that kind

Don't go breaking my heart
You take the weight off of me
Oh, honey, when you knocked on my door
Ooh, I gave you my key
Ooh-hoo, nobody knows it
When I was down
I was your clown
Ooh-hoo, nobody knows it (nobody knows)
Right from the start
I gave you my heart
Oh, I gave you my heart
So don't go breaking my heart
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my heart

Nobody told us
'Cause nobody showed us
And now it's up to us, babe
Oh, I think we can make it
So don't misunderstand me
You put the light in my life
Oh, you put the spark to the flame
I've got your heart in my sights
Ooh-hoo, nobody knows it
But when I was down
I was your clown
Ooh-hoo, nobody knows it (nobody knows)
But right from the start
I gave you my heart
Oh, ho, I gave you my heart
Don't go breaking my heart
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my heart
