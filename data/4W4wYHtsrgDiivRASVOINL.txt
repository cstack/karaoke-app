If you see a faded sign at the side of the road that says
"15 miles to the Love Shack"
Love Shack, yeah, yeah
I'm heading down the Atlanta highway
Looking for the love getaway
♪
Headed for the love getaway
I got me a car, it's as big as a whale
And we're headin' on down to the Love Shack
I got me a Chrysler, it seats about 20
So hurry up and bring your jukebox money
The love shack is a little old place where
We can get together
Love Shack, baby (the Love Shack, baby)
Love Shack, baby, Love Shack
Love Shack, baby, Love Shack
Love Shack, baby, Love Shack (love, baby, that's where it's at)
Love Shack, baby, Love Shack (love, baby, that's where it's at)
Sign says (woo), "Stay away, fools"
'Cause love rules at the Love Shack
Well, it's set way back in the middle of a field
Just a funky old shack and I gotta get back
Glitter on the mattress
Glitter on the highway
Glitter on the front porch
Glitter on the highway
The Love Shack is a little old place where
We can get together
Love Shack, baby (Love Shack, baby)
Love Shack, that's where it's at
Love Shack, that's where it's at
Hugging and a-kissing
Dancing and a-loving
Wearing next to nothing 'cause it's hot as an oven
The whole shack shimmies
Yeah, the whole shack shimmies
The whole shack shimmies when everybody's moving around
And around and around and around
Everybody's moving, everybody's grooving, baby
Folks linin' up outside just to get down
Everybody's moving, everybody's grooving, baby
Funky little shack
Funky little shack!
