Head under water
And they tell me
To breathe easy for a while
The breathing gets harder
Even I know that
Made room for me
But it's too soon to see
If I'm happy in your hands
I'm unusually hard to hold on to
â™ª
Blank stares at blank pages
No easy way to say this
You mean well
But you make this hard on me
I'm not gonna write you a love song 'cause you asked for it
'Cause you need one, you see
I'm not gonna write you a love song 'cause you tell me it's
Make or break in this
If you're on your way
I'm not gonna write you to stay
If all you have is leaving
I'ma need a better reason to write you a love song today (yeah)
Today, yeah
I learned the hard way
That they all say
Things you wanna hear
And my heavy heart
Sinks deep down under
You and your twisted words
Your help just hurts
You are not what
I thought you were
Hello to high and dry
Convinced me to please you
Made me think
That I need this too
I'm trying to let you hear me as I am
I'm not gonna write you a love song 'cause you asked for it
'Cause you need one, you see
I'm not gonna write you a love song 'cause you tell me it's
Make or break in this
If you're on your way
I'm not gonna write you to stay
If all you have is leaving
I'ma need a better reason to write you a love song today
Promise me
That you'll leave the light on
To help me see
With daylight, my guide, gone
'Cause I believe there's a way
You can love me because I say
I won't write you a love song
'Cause you asked for it
'Cause you need one, you see
I'm not gonna write you a love song 'cause you tell me it's
Make or break in this
Is that why you wanted a love song?
'Cause you asked for it
'Cause you need one, you see
I'm not gonna write you a love song 'cause you tell me it's
Make or break in this
If you're on your way
I'm not gonna write you to stay
If your heart is nowhere in it
I don't want it for a minute
Babe, I'll walk the seven seas
When I believe that there's a reason to write you
A love song today
Today, yeah
