It ain't no joke
I'd like to buy the world a toke
And teach the world
To sing in perfect harmony
And teach the world
To snuff the fires and the liars
Hey, I know it's just a song,
But it's spice for the recipe
This is a love attack
I know it went out, but it's back
It's just like any fad,
It retracts before impact
And just like fashion,
It's a passion for the with-it and hip
If you got the goods,
They'll come and buy it
Just to stay in the clique
So don't delay, act now,
Supplies are running out
Allow if you're still alive
Six to eight years to arrive
And if you follow,
There may be a tomorrow
But if the offer's shunned
You might as well be walking on the Sun

Twenty-five years ago,
They spoke out and they broke out
Of recession and oppression
And together they toked
And they folked out with
Guitars around a bonfire
Just singin' and clappin', man,
What the hell happened?
Then some were spellbound,
Some were hellbound
Some, they fell down
And some got back up
And fought back against the meltdown
And their kids were hippie chicks,
All hypocrites
Because fashion is smashing
The true meaning of it
So don't delay, act now,
Supplies are running out
Allow if you're still alive
Six to eight years to arrive
And if you follow,
There may be a tomorrow
But if the offer's shunned
You might as well be walking on the Sun...
♪
It ain't no joke
When a mama's handkerchief is soaked
With her tears because her baby's
Life has been revoked
The bond is broke up
So choke up and focus
On the close up
Mr. Wizard can't perform
No god-like hocus-pocus
So don't sit back, kick back
And watch the world get bushwhacked
News at 10, your neighborhood is under attack
Put away the crack,
Before the crack puts you away
You need to be there
When your baby's old enough to relate
So don't delay, act now,
Supplies are running out
Allow if you're still alive
Six to eight years to arrive
And if you follow,
There may be a tomorrow
But if the offer's shunned
You might as well be walking on the Sun
You might as well be walking on the Sun
You might as well be walking on the Sun
You might as well be walking on the Sun
You might as well be walking on the Sun...
