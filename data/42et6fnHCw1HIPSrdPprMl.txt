I'm packed and I'm holdin'
I'm smilin', she's livin', she's golden
She lives for me, says she lives for me
Ovation, her own motivation
She comes round and she goes down on me
And I make her smile, like a drug for you
Do ever what you wanna do, comin' over you
Keep on smilin' what we go through
One stop to the rhythm, that divides you
And I speak to you like the chorus to the verse
Chop another line like a coda with a curse
Come on like a freak show takes the stage
We give them the games to play, she said
I want somethin' else
To get me through this
Semi-charmed kinda life
Baby, baby
I want somethin' else
I'm not listenin' when you say
Goodbye
♪
The sky was gold, it was rose
I was takin' sips of it through my nose
And I wish I could get back there, someplace back there
Smilin' in the pictures you would take
Doin' crystal meth, will lift you up until you break
It won't stop, I won't come down
I keep stock with the tick-tock rhythm
I bump for the drop, and then I bumped up
I took the hit that I was given, then I bumped again
Then I bumped again, I said
How do I get back there
To the place where I fell asleep inside you?
How do I get myself back to the place where you said
I want somethin' else
To get me through this
Semi-charmed kinda life
Baby, baby
I want somethin' else
I'm not listenin' when you say
Goodbye
I believe in the sand beneath my toes
The beach gives a feeling, an earthy feeling
I believe in the faith that grows
And the four right chords can make me cry
When I'm with you I feel like I could die
And that would be alright, alright
And when the plane came in, she said she was crashin'
The velvet it rips in the city
We tripped on the urge to feel alive
Now I'm struggling to survive
Those days you were wearing that velvet dress
You're the priestess, I must confess
Those little red panties they pass the test
Slides up around the belly, face down on the mattress
One
And you hold me, and we're broken
Still it's all that I wanna do, just a little now
Feel myself, heavy on the ground
I'm scared, I'm not comin' down
No, no
And I won't run for my life
She's got her jaws now locked down in a smile
But nothin' is alright, alright
And I want somethin' else
To get me through this life
Baby, I want somethin' else
Not listenin' when you say
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
