You change your mind like a girl changes clothes
Yeah, you, PMS like a bitch, I would know
And you overthink, always speak cryptically
I should know that you're no good for me
'Cause you're hot, then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black, and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
(You) you don't really wanna stay, no
(You) but you don't really wanna go, oh
You're hot, then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down
