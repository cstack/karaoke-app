Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better
Hey Jude, don't be afraid
You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better
And any time you feel the pain
Hey Jude, refrain
Don't carry the world upon your shoulder
For, well, you know that it's a fool
Who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder
Na, na, na, na-na, na, na, na-na
Hey Jude, don't let me down
You have found her, now go and get her (let it out and let it in)
Remember (hey Jude) to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better
Better, better, better, better (I'm begging you), better, oh!
Na, na, na, na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, hey Jude
Na, na, na, na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, hey Jude
Na, na, na, na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, hey Jude (Jude)
Na, na, na, na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, hey Jude
(Yeah, you know you can make)
(Jude, Jude, you're not gonna break it)
Na, na, na, na-na-na-na (don't make it bad, Jude)
(Take a sad song and make it better) na-na-na-na, hey Jude
(Hey Jude, Jude, hey Jude, wow!)
Na, na, na, na-na-na-na (ooh, Jude)
Na-na-na-na, hey Jude (hey Jude)
Na, na, na, na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, hey Jude
Na, na, na, na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, hey Jude
Na, na, na, na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, hey Jude
