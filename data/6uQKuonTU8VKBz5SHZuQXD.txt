This is how we do it
(This is how we do it)
(This is how we do it)
This is how we do it
It's Friday night and I feel all right
The party is here on the West side
So I reach for my 40 and I turn it up
Designated driver take the keys to my truck
Hit the shore 'cause I'm faded
Honey's in the street say, Monty, yo we made it
It feels so good in my hood tonight
The summertime skirts and my guys in Kani
All the gang bangers forgot about the drive-by
You gotta get your groove on before you go get paid
So tip up your cup and throw your hands up
And let me hear the party say
I'm kinda buzzed and it's all because
(This is how we do it)
South Central does it like nobody does
(This is how we do it)
To all my neighbors, you got much flavor
(This is how we do it)
Let's flip the track, bring the old school back
(This is how we do it)
This is how we do it, all hands are in the air
And wave them from here to there
If you're an OG mack or a wanna-be player
You see the hood's been good to me
Ever since I was a lower case G
But now I'm a big G
The girls see I got the money
Hundred dollar bills, y'all
If you were from where I'm from
Then you would know
That I gotta get mine in a big black truck
You can get yours in a '64
Whatever it is, the party's underway
So tip up your cup and throw your hands up
And let me hear the party say
I'm kinda buzzed, it's all because
(This is how we do it)
South Central does it like nobody does
(This is how we do it)
To all my neighbors, you got much flavor
(This is how we do it)
Let's flip the track, bring the old school back
(This is how we do it)
I'm kinda buzzed, it's all because
(This is how we do it)
South Central does it like nobody does, nobody does
(This is how we do it)
YNV, SCC
(This is how we do it) All my homies
I'll never come wack on an old school track
(This is how we do it)
Check it out
Once upon a time in '94
Montell made no money and life sure was slow
And all they said was 6'8 he stood
And people thought the music that he made was good
There lived a DJ and Paul was his name
He came up to Monty, this is what he said
You and OG are gonna make some cash
Sell a million records and we're making the dash
Oh, I'm buzzing because
(This is how we do it)
South Central does it like nobody does
(This is how we do it)
To all my neighbors, you got much flavor
(This is how we do it)
I'll never come wack on an old school track
(This is how we do it)
I'm kinda buzzed, it's all because
(This is how we do it)
South Central does it like nobody does, nobody does
(This is how we do it)
Oh, it's party time
(This is how we do it)
Straight up coming from the west side
(This is how we do it)
Oh, she's got the flavor, yeah
(This is how we do it)
And Monty does it like nobody does
(This is how we do it)
Come on now, Def Jam
You know that this is how we do it
This is how we do it
Yo Montell, this Percy, man, the barber, your barber
Man, I'm sitting up here listening to your tape, dude
And this shit is on, man
You gon' make it, fool
Keep on doing what you doing, man
My phone number is area code 909, 0, 80
Gimme a call, man
We getting ready to step out to the Fox Hills Mall right now, but uh
