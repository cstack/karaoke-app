At first I was afraid
I was Petrified
Kept thinking I could never live
Without you by my side
But then I spent so many night
Thinking how you did me wrong
And I grew strong
And I learned how to get along
And so you're back
From outer space
I just walked in to find you here
With that sad look upon your face
I should have change that stupid lock
I should have made you leave your key
If I had known for just one second
You'd be back to bother me
Go on now go
Walk out the door
Just turn around now
Cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye
You think I'd crumble
You think I'd lay down and die
Oh no not I
I will survive
Oh as long as I know how to love
I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live
And I got all my love to give
I'll survive
I will survive
Hey hey
â™ª
It took all the strength I had
Not to fall apart
Kept trying hard to mend the pieces
Of my broken heart
And I spent oh so many nights
Just feeling sorry for myself
I used to cry
But now I hold my head up high
And you see me
Somebody new
I'm not that chained up little person
Still in love with you
And so you felt like dropping in
And just expect me to be free
Well now I'm saving all my lovin'
For someone who's loving me
Go on now go
Walk out the door
Just turn round now
Cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye
You think I'd crumble
You think I'd lay down and die
Oh no not I
I will survive
Oh as long as I know how to love
I know I'll stay alive
I got all my life to live
And I've got all my love to give
And I'll survive
I will survive
Oh
Go on now go
Walk out the door
Just turn around now
Cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye
You think I'd crumble
You think I'd lay down and die
Oh no not I
I will survive
Oh as long as I know how to love
I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to give
And I've got all my love to give
And I'll survive
I will survive
I will survive
