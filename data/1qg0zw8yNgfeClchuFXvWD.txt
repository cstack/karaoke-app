Where are those happy days
They seem so hard to find
I try to reach for you
But you have closed your mind
Whatever happened to our love?
I wish I understood
It used to be so nice
It used to be so good
So when you're near me
Darling, can't you hear me, S.O.S.
The love you gave me
Nothing else can save me, S.O.S.
When you're gone
How can I even try to go on?
When you're gone
Though I try, how can I carry on?
You seemed so far away
Though you were standing near
You made me feel alive
But something died, I fear
I really tried to make it up
I wish I understood
What happened to our love?
It used to be so good
So when you're near me
Darling, can't you hear me, S.O.S.
The love you gave me
Nothing else can save me, S.O.S.
When you're gone
How can I even try to go on?
When you're gone
Though I try, how can I carry on?

So when you're near me
Darling, can't you hear me, S.O.S.
And the love you gave me
Nothing else can save me, S.O.S.
When you're gone
How can I even try to go on?
When you're gone
Though I try, how can I carry on?
When you're gone
How can I even try to go on?
When you're gone
Though I try, how can I carry on?
