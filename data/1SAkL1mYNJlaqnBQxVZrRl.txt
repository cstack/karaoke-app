Oh my God
Becky, look at her butt
It's so big
She looks like one of those rap guys' girlfriends
But, you know
Who understands those rap guys?
They only talk to her because she looks like a total prostitute, okay
I mean her butt
It's just so big
I can't believe it's so round
It's like, out there
I mean, it's gross
Look, she's just so black
I like big butts and I cannot lie
You other brothers can't deny
That when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist
And a round thing in your face
You get sprung
Wanna pull up tough
'Cause you notice that butt was stuffed
Deep in the jeans she's wearing
I'm hooked and I can't stop staring
Oh, baby I wanna get with ya
And take your picture
My homeboys tried to warn me
But that butt you got
Makes (me so horny)
Ooh, rump of smooth skin
You say you wanna get in my Benz
Well use me, use me 'cause you aint that average groupie
I've seen them dancin'
To hell with romancin'
She's sweat and wet
Got it goin' like a turbo 'Vette
I'm tired of magazines
Saying flat butts are the thing
Take the average black man and ask him that
She gotta pack much back
So, fellas! (Yeah), fellas (yeah)
Has your girlfriend got the butt? (Hell yeah)
Tell 'em to shake it! (Shake it), shake it (shake it)
Shake that healthy butt
Baby got back!
(L.A. face with a Oakland booty)
Baby got back!
(L.A. face with a Oakland booty)
(L.A. face with a Oakland booty)
I like 'em round and big
And when I'm throwin a gig
I just can't help myself
I'm actin like an animal
Now here's my scandal
I wanna get you home
And ugh, double-up, ugh, ugh
I ain't talkin' 'bout Playboy
'Cause silicone parts are made for toys
I want 'em real thick and juicy
So find that juicy double
Mix-a-Lot's in trouble
Beggin' for a piece of that bubble
So I'm lookin' at rock videos
Knock-kneeded bimbos walkin' like hoes
You can have them bimbos
I'll keep my women like Flo Jo
A word to the thick soul sistas, I wanna get with ya
I won't cuss or hit ya
But I gotta be straight when I say I wanna
'Til the break of dawn
Baby got it goin' on
A lot of simps won't like this song
'Cause them punks like to hit it and quit it
And I'd rather stay and play
'Cause I'm long, and I'm strong
And I'm down to get the friction on
So, ladies (yeah), ladies (yeah)
If you wanna roll in my Mercedes (yeah)
Then turn around, stick it out
Even white boys got to shout

Baby got back
Yeah, baby, when it comes to females, Cosmo ain't got nothin'
To do with my selection, 36-24-36? Ha-ha, only if she's 5'3"
So your girlfriend rolls a Honda
Playin' workout tapes by Fonda
But Fonda ain't got a motor in the back of her Honda
My anaconda don't want none
Unless you've got buns, hun
You can do side bends or sit-ups
But please don't lose that butt
Some brothers wanna play that hard role
And tell you that the butt ain't gold
So they toss it and leave it
And I pull up quick to retrieve it
So Cosmo says you're fat
Well I ain't down with that
'Cause your waist is small and your curves are kickin'
And I'm thinkin' 'bout stickin'
To the beanpole dames in the magazines
You ain't it, Miss Thing
Give me a sister, I can't resist her
Red beans and rice didn't miss her
Some knucklehead tried to diss
'Cause his girls are on my list
He had game but he chose to hit 'em
And I pull up quick to get wit 'em
So ladies, if the butt is round
And you want a triple X throw down
Dial 1-900-Mix-A-Lot
And kick them nasty thoughts
