Once upon a time
(Not so long ago)
Tommy used to work on the docks
Union's been on strike
He's down on his luck
It's tough, so tough
♪
Gina works the diner all day
Working for her man
She brings home her pay for love
Mmm, for love
She says, we've gotta hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We got each other and that's a lot for love
We'll give it a shot
Whoa
We're half way there
Whoa-oh
Livin' on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it, I swear
Whoa-oh
Livin' on a prayer

Tommy got his six string in hock
Now he's holding in what he used to make it talk
So tough, ooh it's tough

Gina dreams of running away
When she cries in the night
Tommy whispers, baby it's okay
Someday
We've gotta hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We got each other and that's a lot for love
We'll give it a shot
Whoa
We're half way there
Whoa-oh
Livin' on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it I swear
Whoa-oh
Livin' on a prayer
Livin' on a prayer
♪
Ooh, we gotta hold on, ready or not
You live for the fight when that's all that you've got
Whoa
We're half way there
Whoa-oh
Livin' on a prayer
Take my hand and we'll make it, I swear
Whoa-oh
Livin' on a prayer
